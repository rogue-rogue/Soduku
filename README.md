# Soduku
Little soduku game

I built this game for interaction in python's interactive shell but I want to try and write some CSS to make the gameplay much better. 

A brief google suggests that I will need to use a framework to link python and CSS as they are not naturally compatible (in the ammer than CSS and HTML are).
